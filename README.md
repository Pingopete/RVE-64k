Overview:

This is a work in progress project to bring the highest posible visual fidelity to RealSolarSystem modified KerbalSpaceProgram.
This prject is based around adding a 64k terrain texture and 32k clouds among other features to Earth.

Consider this a cinematic tool only in its current state: Currently only Earth orbit is being worked on and tested,
no other planets or even in-atmosphere Earth has been tested or modified.

VERY HEAVY ON GPU LOAD!

Test Rig: i7-8700k/GTX 970/16gb ram

Ram usage in game: 10-12GB

(Don't expect average FPS above 40 unless you're rocking an RTX series GPU).


Requirements:

KerbalSpaceProgram v1.7.3

EVE v1.7.3

Scatterer v0.0540

RealSolarSystem (Latest Version - currently designed for KSP 1.6.1)

Kopernicus 1.7.3-2


Main Features:

64k Earth Terrain and Borders (down-scaled from 128k)

32k Clouds (with experimental opacity)

KS3P Integration (Including Eye Adaptation for Earth's dark side)


Preliminary/Placeholder work:

64k City Light mask (cutout from terrain saving memory usage).

Cloud light pollution

Lightning in Storms

Auroras
