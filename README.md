  ## Overview:

*I am the original author of RVE (RSS Visual Enhancements) or commonly abbreviated to Real Visual Enhancmenets that I was working on in 2014-2016. While I've been on hiatus, PhineasFreak aquired my permission and has been maintaining and builing upon my mod under the title RSSVE (RSS Visual Enhancements). I am now back and am working on a new project that uses many of my older textures as placeholders, uses and modifies some of RSSVE's assets and adds many new textures of my own. (I have spoken with PhineasFreak and he's happy for me to encorperate his assets). This project seeks to push the limits in KSP 1 before KSP 2 modding community gets going*

  - This is a work in progress project to bring the highest posible visual fidelity to RealSolarSystem modified KerbalSpaceProgram.
This prject is based around adding a 64k terrain texture and 32k clouds among other features to Earth.
  - Consider this a cinematic tool only in its current state: Currently __only Earth orbit is being worked on and tested, no other planets or even in-atmosphere Earth has been tested or modified.__

  ###### VERY HEAVY ON GPU LOAD!

  - Test Rig: i7-8700k/GTX 970/16gb ram
  - __Ram usage in game: 10-12GB__
  - Don't expect average FPS above 40 unless you're rocking an RTX series GPU

  ## Requirements:

  - __KerbalSpaceProgram v1.7.3__
  - __EVE v1.7.3__
  - __Scatterer v0.0540__
  - __RealSolarSystem (Latest Version - currently designed for KSP 1.6.1)__
  - __Kopernicus 1.7.3-2__
  - __KSP Running in DirectX 11__
